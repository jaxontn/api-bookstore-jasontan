Table Existence and Constraints

    User: 
    Can exist independently. 
    It is not dependent on any other table. 
    An Order can exist without a corresponding User 
    (which would be unusual and likely a constraint 
    in real scenarios, but possible in schema terms).


    Book: 
    Can exist independently but must have a 
    unique bookDetailId pointing to BookDetail. A Book
    must have an associated BookDetail, but BookDetail 
    can be optional (Book?).


    BookDetail: 
    BookDetail must have a unique bookId that refers to a Book.


    Order: 
    Can exist independently, but in practice, 
    it will always have a User due to the foreign key 
    constraint. An Order without a User would violate 
    the foreign key constraint.    


    OrderItem: 
    It requires both an Order and a Book to exist because 
    of the foreign key constraints.
